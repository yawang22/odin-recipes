        <h2>A Classic Chinese Dish</h2>
        
            <p>Chow Fun, also known as Chow Hoh Fun, is a a staple Cantonese dish made from stir-frying beef,   wide rice noodles, and bean sprouts. It gets its name from the quaint town of Shahe in Guangzhou, where its distinctive style of flat rice noodles was first created. As more Chinese people started coming to America in the 40s and 50s, over two-thirds of them were Guangdong Yan. And up until the 60s and 70s, Chinese food in America was primarily Cantonese cuisine. That's why, today, Cantonese dishes like Chow Fun and Chow Mein are still among the most popular dishes across over 40,000 Chinese restaurants in America.</p>
            <p>While there are many variations of this dish made today in America, this is by far the most common version found in China. Growing up, I often made this as one of my go to dish of comfort as it was simple and always reminded me of home no matter where I was. I hope by making this, you too can enjoy a quick and simple taste of China!</p>

                <li>Stir-fry yellow onions and white part of green onion until fragrant, then add the rice noodles, gently stirring until golden brown. Then add the chow fun sauce. Add green parts of scallion and bean sprouts and cook for 30-45 seconds.</li>
