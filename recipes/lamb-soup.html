        <h2>A Comforting Winter Soup</h2>
        
            <p>This is a classic winter soup hailing from the Northeast provinces of China where it is often bitterly cold. Famous for their cauldrons of stew, this dish is certainly a must when visiting the countryside. They even have a major tourist attraction in Harbin called "Ice and Snow World" where I visited a few years ago and had all my devices promptly die because it was just that cold! Composed of saurkraut, rice noodles, and thinly sliced lamb meat, its a soup sure to warm your soul. Much like a shabu-shabu or hotpot, most of the cooking happens after the dish is taken off the stove. Though I didn't get to enjoy this dish as much as I would have liked growing up due to the cost of lamb, it was still one of the dishes I always asked for when it came to winter and my birthday (which is in winter)! Though I'll admit I am a bit of a soup fiend in general.</p>
