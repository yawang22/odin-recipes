        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Flour - 3 Tbsp</li>
                <li>Sugar - 1½ Tbsp </li>
                <li>Baking Powder - ¼ tsp </li>
                <li>Cinnamon - ⅛ tsp</li>
                <li>Salt - 1 pinch</li>
                <li>Unsweetened Milk - 3 Tbsp</li> 
                <li>Vegetable Oil - 1 Tbsp</li>
                <li>Vanilla Extract - ¼ tsp</li>
                <li>Blueberries - 3 Tbsp</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>    
            <ol>
                <li>In a microwave-safe mug, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
                <li>Next add the milk, oil, and vanilla extract. Mix until just combined. Be careful not to over-mix.</li>
                <li>Then gently fold in the blueberries.</li>
                <li>Microwave on high (800 - 900 W) for 2 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. The cooking time may vary depending on your microwave and settings. If the cake isn't cooked through yet, simply place it back in the microwave at intervals of 15 seconds until done.</li>
                <li>Let the mug cake cool slightly, add your desired toppings, and enjoy!</li>
